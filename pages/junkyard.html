      <p>Jussi Parikka’s essay, <a href="https://malware.hetnieuweinstituut.nl/en/malware-operational-art-ifthen-geopolitics-and-tricksters">“Malware as Operational Art: On the If/Then of Geopolitics and Tricksters,”</a> encourages a reconsideration of glitches and instances of computer failure as the norm.</p>
  
      <img src="pages-media/junkyard-rep.jpg" alt="A book cover against a patch of dead grass. The cover reads, 'This book you are holding is an unkempt garden, a junkyard. Let the weeds overgrow, hack through [the fences].' Its text is green, printed on newsprint. A sliver of the cover is cut out, revealing a green pattern in the interior.">
      <p>Continuing my research into interface metaphors, the structure of this book references the skeletal syntax of the web and the layered, nested anatomy of HTML. Smaller moves — the unravelling typography and cut paper revealing a computer-generated texture on the inner folds — seek to reinforce this theme of perceived danger, offering an uneasy, anti-reader friendly experience.</p>

      <p>The use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_(sans-serif_typeface)">San Francisco</a> references the visual language of Apple products, whereas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Apple_typefaces#Script_and_handwritten">Apple Chancery</a> embodies the sprawl of weeds and hints at contagion. A condensed <a href="https://authentic.website/sans.html">Authentic Sans</a> invites the reader to reconsider what a book can be — as seen in the front cover, which seeks to act as a billboard.</p>
