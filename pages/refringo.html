      <p>An homage to two installation pieces around the Sam Fox School, this interactive alphabet is an exercise in modular design and relationships between part and whole. The alphabet’s name comes from <em>refringere</em>, Latin for “to break up or open, to refract.” I wanted to capture the delicate quality of light that I’d been able to appreciate in these familiar campus spaces, having encountered these artworks across different moments of the day.</p>

      <p>While I had designed a similar set of modular letters a year prior, the chief challenge for this project was articulating and animating the Latin alphabet in a concise way wherein small, gradual changes could build on each other to bring about unique, generative visual compositions.</p>

      <p>With the added requirement that this alphabet be entirely coded from HTML &lt;div&gt; elements (with CSS styling applied), I soon realized that my prior subtractive approach to designing letterforms would be troublesome. Ultimately I settled on a direction based on a single rectangular stroke, sheared and warped to remain legible as each individual letter.</p>
      <p>After fine-tuning microinteractions (how do the modules react to the cursor?) and testing different transformations based on various hover states, user-generated motion works with controlled chance operations to reflect the artworks’ quiet, ethereal atmosphere.</p>
