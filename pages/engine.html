      <p>As a collaborative exercise in engineering an as hands-off as possible mememaking tool, I teamed up with Nathan Springman to program a DrawBot script that yields letter-sized memes, typeset in a range of artful and contentious fonts. With melting, machine learning-generated wojaks<sup><a target="_self" href="#wojak">[1]</a></sup> from Nathan and my code for typesetting randomly-chosen fonts in layouts that range from a single image macro<sup><a target="_self" href="#imagemacro">[2]</a></sup> to a 3×3 pseudo-alignment chart,<sup><a target="_self" href="#alignmentchart">[3]</a></sup> our final sampler serendipitously reveals a potential beauty in such inky, uncanny compositions.</p><br>
