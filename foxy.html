				<p>An homage to Wes Anderson's 2009 adaptation of Roald Dahlâ€™s novel, <em>Fantastic Mr. Fox</em>, this app serves as an exhaustive guide to the film, highlighting important plot points, Mr. Fox's existential crises, and the use of "cuss."</p>
				<p>Especially well known for his flat, geometric visual language and use of planimetric composition, Wes Anderson's take on Dahl's book presents a golden, autumnal landscape in which the various animal characters wrestle with the messiness of relationships and love.</p>

				<h1>Concepting + Results</h1>
				<p>I was interested in the bold, energetic use of color and simple navigation in games such as Two Dots and Pocket Frog, as <em>Fantastic Mr. Fox</em> similarly has an upbeat tone of voice and a gamelike pace. Drawing from the film's color palette, the landing screen juxtaposes orange hues with rich shades of blue, a pair of complementary colors that Anderson uses heavily throughout the movie. Detailed character introduction pages supplement the linear, summative view of the story.</p>
				<p>The app uses iconography from the movie, such as a hexagonal button to drag along the central timeline, to annotate significant events and characters.</p>

				<h1>Insights + Room for Improvement</h1>
				<p>While a rewarding study in design systems, this app could've benefited from more standardization in gradients and a simplified color scheme. Explorations of a more immersive mode of navigation that's as dramatic as dragging could also help align the app with the movie stylistically, mimicking Anderson's whimsical signature style of compass point editing.</p>
