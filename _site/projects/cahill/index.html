        <h1>Digital Sky Surveys</h1>
        <p>Observational astronomers and astrophysicists often work across different frequency ranges (“bands”) along the electromagnetic spectrum, specializing in certain bands and their measuring instruments. Various facilities/observatories house these instruments, releasing data at various cadences as part of various sky surveys. This data takes two forms: images of the cosmos capturing potential astronomical objects, and quantitative measurements of these potential objects that represent images abstractly.</p>
<p>Scientists face a Big Data problem given the sheer volume of data available—across multiple frequencies, taken at different times, and measuring different properties—whose querying is fragmented and tied to positional coordinates, making it challenging to get a sense of how one is situated within the data. Image artifacts complicate this further, trickling down into catalogs and potentially biasing measurements. Data validation and verification is thus crucial so that researchers can confirm that different representations of a potential object across bands are correctly correlated for anomaly detection and hypothesis formation.</p>
<p>Collaborating with radio astronomers at Caltech, I developed a frontend UX probe based on close observation of their working methods and habits. The probe makes explicit data coverage of publicly available sky survey data over time and frequency, and incorporates a dimensionality reduction flow so that researchers can define potential objects of interest, drawing from personal expertise and intuition.</p>

<p>As a design provocation addressing a rich and multifaceted challenge emergent in the field for some time, this project was an invaluable opportunity for me to learn how to impose design constraints and narrow scope as a complete outsider and novice. Rapid, week-long co-design sessions informed the final prototype and the earlier exploratory phase called for making a wild range of conversational artifacts, all with the goal of developing a common language to better clarify intent, shared commonalities across subdomains, and the positionality of the project as it is situated within scientists’ methodologies.</p>
