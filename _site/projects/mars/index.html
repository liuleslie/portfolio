        <h1>Mars 2020 Hindsight</h1>
        <p>The Mars 2020 mission requires meticulous coordination and communication across engineering, science, and operations to ensure that various teams can conduct research on Mars safely and efficiently. In order to convey contextual information—whether it be environmental or rover-specific—for decision making, Rover Operators need to correlate snapshots of various data across several decoupled tools, a manually intensive process that is also incredibly reliant on personal memory. This results in significant cognitive burden, makes planning time-consuming, and presents a barrier during training of new personnel, given the reliance on unwritten, institutional knowledge.</p>

<p>Design probes from contextual inquiry and interviews to better gain an appreciation for how Operators relate to their tools.</p>
<p>Over the course of a ten-week design sprint including five weeks of explorations and experimentation, we developed Hindsight, a tool that incorporates a search engine so that Operators can more easily surface similar past drives from the mission, whether via discrete, human-defined conditions, or algorithmically inferred based on functional similarity to a reference drive.</p>

<p>The rover’s position on the orbital map, drive imagery, and flight software logs all synchronized via playhead.</p>
<p>To assist in engaged data analysis, we ensured that Hindsight is flexible to support side-by-side comparisons of past drives, outfitting the frontend with a playhead such that Operators can scrub along the trajectory of a drive. The interface’s layout is customizable to suit personal preference, showing relevant data unified in the same context.</p>
